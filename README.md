# COM6516 Statistical Language Model

## Overview

This project is a Java-based implementation of a Statistical Language Model, developed for the COM6516 module. It demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building N-gram models (Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams) from scratch.

Unlike standard applications, this project implements custom data structures (**Hash Table** and **Linked List**) without relying on the Java Collections Framework, providing a deep dive into algorithmic efficiency and data structure design.

## 🚀 How to Run

This application is a standalone Java Swing application. No external libraries are required.

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

### Compilation & Execution

Navigate to the `code` directory in your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. Compile all Java files
javac *.java

# 2. Run the main application
java MyLanguageModel
```

## ⚠️ Important Note: Performance Warning

### First Letter Hash Function

The application includes a "First Letter Hash" option to demonstrate the impact of poor hash functions.

**Behavior**

* When loading `news.txt` with "First Letter Hash" selected, the application may appear to freeze or become unresponsive for 1–2 minutes.

**Reason**

* This is normal and expected behavior.
* The algorithm intentionally clusters thousands of words starting with the same letter (e.g., `t`, `s`) into single linked lists.
* Inserting thousands of items into a sorted linked list has a time complexity of **O(N²)**, causing significant processing delay.

**Action**

* Please wait patiently until the status bar updates to "Loaded".
* Do not force close the application.

**Contrast**

* This behavior contrasts with the Polynomial Hash, which loads instantly due to efficient **O(1)** distribution.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Custom Data Structures

* **MyHashTable**
  A custom implementation of a hash table handling collision via chaining.

* **MyLinkedObject**
  A custom linked list node that stores word frequencies.

**Design Note**

This class uses an Iterative approach (loops) instead of Recursion. This was a deliberate design choice to prevent `StackOverflowError` when handling the extreme chain lengths (depth > 4000) produced by the First Letter Hash.

---

### 2. Hash Function Strategy

Users can switch strategies at runtime to compare efficiency:

* **Polynomial Hash**
  Uses a rolling hash algorithm:

  [ h = 31h + c ]

* **First Letter Hash**
  Uses the first character:

  [ h = \text{char}[0] % \text{size} ]

---

### 3. Visualization (HistogramPanel)

* A custom-painted Swing component that visualizes the internal state of the Hash Table.
* Displays the distribution of collision chain lengths.
* Allows visual verification of the "Avalanche Effect" (or lack thereof).

---

### 4. N-Gram Prediction

* **Bigram & Trigram Models**
  The system builds statistical models to predict the next word in a sequence based on conditional probabilities.

* **GUI**
  Users can input a starting phrase (e.g., `"it is"`) and generate a sequence of up to 20 likely following words.
